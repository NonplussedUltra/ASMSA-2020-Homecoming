### Schedule

The Discord server will remain open from Friday, October 23rd through Sunday, October 25th, all the time, so if you don't see anybody there at first, leave a message so your classmates can find you!

### Faculty Appearances

Faculty and staff are welcome on the server any time, but a few of them have agreed to be available at specific times on Zoom so you know when to catch them!

  * Mr. James Katowich (English) - Sunday at 6pm
  
Visit the #faculty-chat channel on the Discord to access their individual Zoom meetings.

### Other Homecoming Features

In a normal year, we'd just invite everyone to the ASMSA campus to see what's new! But in lieu of that, we've assembled a few ways for alumni to see what has changed since their time at ASMSA:
  * A presention by Director Corey Alderdice about the Strategic Plan for the future of ASMSA
  * A campus tour presented by Deana Hughes '10 and current students

And we have space to remember what ASMSA was like when we were there:
  * A living photo gallery to compile the ASMSA photos people share over the course of the weekend
  * A memorial space for people to pay their respects to our friend and mentor Dr. Jon Ruehle, recently departed on October 17th.
